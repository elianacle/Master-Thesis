# Master-Thesis
This repository includes R-code for the implementation of the statistical models included in my thesis with the title "Analysis of Intensive Longitudinal Data using R-INLA". We aim to analyze sensor data for monitoring heart failure using R-INLA. 

The file "Univariate_TS_s3s1.Rmd" and "Univariate_TS_NHR.Rmd" include models for time series analysis for heart sounds and heart rate.
The file "Multivele_Modeling_S3S1_NHR.Rmd" includes multilevel models such as mixed effects models and multilevel Autoregressive models
The file VAR includes vector autoregressive models

The R script "functions.R" has the function for calculating MAE and MAPE.
